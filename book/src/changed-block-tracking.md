## Overview

This optional feature provides a secure mechanism to obtain metadata
on the allocated blocks of a CSI VolumeSnapshot, or the changed blocks between two arbitrary pairs of CSI VolumeSnapshot objects of the same PersistentVolume.
See [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal 3314](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3314-csi-changed-block-tracking) 
for full details.

A CSI driver must advertise its support for this feature by specifying the
`SNAPSHOT_METADATA_SERVICE` capability in the response of the
[GetPluginCapabilities](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#getplugincapabilities)
RPC (part of the
[CSI Identity Service](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#identity-service-rpc)),
and must implement the
[CSI SnapshotMetadata Service](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#snapshot-metadata-service-rpcs).

CSI drivers that implement this feature should deploy the
[external-snapshot-metadata](./external-snapshot-metadata.md)
sidecar and create the associated 
[Snapshot Metadata Service CR](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3314-csi-changed-block-tracking#snapshot-metadata-service-custom-resource).

The `external-snapshot-metadata` sidecar implements the server side of the
[Kubernetes SnapshotMetadata Service API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3314-csi-changed-block-tracking#the-kubernetes-snapshotmetadata-service-api).
Backup applications obtain VolumeSnapshot metadata directly from the sidecar
through this API, bypassing the Kubernetes API server for the most part.
Backup application developers should refer to the [Usage](external-snapshot-metadata.md#usage)
and [Resources](external-snapshot-metadata.md#resources)
sections of the sidecar documentation for details.
