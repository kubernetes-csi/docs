# Setup

To use CSI drivers, your Kubernetes cluster must allow privileged pods (i.e. `--allow-privileged` flag must be set to `true` for both the API server and the kubelet). This is the default in some environments (e.g. GCE, GKE, `kubeadm`).

Moreover, as stated in the [mount propagation docs][mount-propagation-docs], the Docker daemon of the cluster nodes must allow shared mounts. [This page][docker-shared-mount] explains how to check if shared mounts are enabled and how to configure Docker for shared mounts.

This document has been updated to the latest version of Kubernetes v1.11.

## Alpha Features

#### CSI Raw block volume support

[CSI Raw block volume support][rawvol]: To enable support for raw block volumes
you mest set the following feature gate on Kubernetes v1.11:

```
--feature-gates=BlockVolume=true,CSIBlockVolume=true
```

Also, see [Raw Block Volume Support][rawsupport]

#### Kubelet Plugin Watcher

[Kubelet Plugin Watcher][plugin-watcher]: To enable support for Kubelet plugin
watcher for CSI plugins, the following flag must be set in kubelet:

```
--feature-gates=KubeletPluginsWatcher=true
```

You will also need to use the following flag in your `driver-registrar` side-car
container with the value set to the location of CSI driver socket on the host:

```
--kubelet-registration-path: Enables Kubelet Plugin Registration service and sets the
  path of the CSI driver socket on the host machine (typically at
  /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/<driver-name>/csi.sock). If this option is set, the
  driver-registrar exposes a unix domain socket (at /registration) to handle Kubelet
  Plugin Registration. This socket MUST be surfaced on the host in the kubelet plugin
  registration directory (in addition to the CSI driver socket). If plugin registration
  is enabled on kubelet (kubelet flag KubeletPluginsWatcher is set), then this option
  should be set.
```

In addition, in order to expose the registration socket to the host, the
`driver-registrar` side-car container must have a HostPath volume, with the
kubelet plugin directory as the host path (typically at
`/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/`), mounted at `/registration` in the container.

```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: registration-dir
  mountPath: /registration

...
volumes:
- name: registration-dir
  hostPath:
      path: /var/lib/kubelet/plugins
      type: Directory
```
